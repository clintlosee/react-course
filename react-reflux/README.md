# React Using Reflux

### Project Development Instructions
This is a sample application using React with Reflux. It is based on React and NodeJS.

To use this application, you must install NodeJS.
`cd` into your desired directory and then `git clone` the repository.
After you clone the repository, you need to install the project's dependencies.  To do so, run the following command:

    npm install

To compile JS files, run:

    npm start

To start the server, run:

    node server.js

You then can access the site at: [Localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
